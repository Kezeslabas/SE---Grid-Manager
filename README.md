# SE---Grid-Manager

This is an in-game script for my personal use in the game, Sapce Engineers. It's the combination of a couple of simple but useful scripts that I made while I'm playing tha game. It's designed so the different script can be used from the same in-game Programamble Blocks, by gicing it different arguments.

This script is not published in the steam workshop yet, since I'm constantly working on it, while I'm playing.
